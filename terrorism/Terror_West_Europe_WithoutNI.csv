On April 3, 2004, seven key suspects committed suicide during a police raid on their Madrid apartment; among of whom was Jamal Ahmidan, a Moroccan believed to have been the central figure in the financing, planning and execution of the attacks. According to the Associated Press, it cost the perpetrators $120,000 to carry out the attacks, ranging from the cost of buying explosives to renting safe-houses. Of the 29 charged, three men were charged with murder: Jamal Zougam, a Moroccan merchant who allegedly supplied the cell phones used as detonators; Emilio Suarez Trashorras, a Spaniard accused of supplying the dynamite; and Abdelmajid Bouchar, a Moroccan.

"07/22/2011: On Friday afternoon, in Hole, Buskerud County, Norway, in one of two related attacks, a man identified as Anders Breivik and dressed as a police officer, rode a ferry from the city to the island of Utoya, which is the location of a youth camp that is run by Norway's ruling Labor Party. He told the ferry driver that he needed to go to the island and check that everything was secure because of the bombing that just took place in the city. Once on the island, Breivik identified himself as a police officer and then opened fire on the camp attendees with his semi-automatic, 5.56 caliber Ruger Mini-14 rifle and a 9 millimeter Glock pistol. Due to the camp's location on the remote island, Breivik was able to kill 69 people and injure at least 60 others, including teenagers, before the police could reach the scene. The attack caused an unknown amount of property damage to the camp. Once the police arrived Breivik surrendered without a fight and was taken into custody.
